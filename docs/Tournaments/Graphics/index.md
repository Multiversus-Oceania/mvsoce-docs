## How to pull character and skin pngs from the game files
1. Download [**Fmodel**](https://fmodel.app/).
2. Open Fmodel and target the multiversus paks directory. Default path:  
`C:\Program Files(x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\MultiVersus\MultiVersus\Content\Paks`
3. It will then ask you for an AES key before you can open it in Fmodel. AES Key:
`0x419DFFC484F1CED86842DD4E6DD914F02E3E119725F556C4B9AA44432021A9AC`
4. Download the [mapping file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WCCGeb21is4NvQr_qKHGlnay0YqjCegp/view?usp=drive_link)
5. Go to settings and tick 'local mapping file' and add a file path to the mappings.usmap file above
6. The directory for the character pngs is:  
`pakchunk0-windows.utc/Multiversus/Content/Character/Captures`

Additionally, you can refer to this [**video walkthrough**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Y1E9y6OAK4) for step-by-step
